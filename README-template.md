## My process

I startet out with the HTML and worked my way through it by styling with css for the mobile version. It's much easier when you have the measurements from figma. I finished the project with adding a media query to make the card slightly bigger when displayed on a tablet or desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to set the gap sizes between the different flex items in a flex box with the gap property and how to set a footer with position: absolute.
